# Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue
Vercel deployed but showing old content:
- ❌ Still shows "Video Chat Platform" instead of "CHATTER BOX"
- ❌ Old branding and styling not updated
- ❌ Missing glassmorphism effects and custom fonts

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected (Local Code):
- ✅ Title: "CHATTER BOX" 
- ✅ Font: Bitcount Prop Double Ink
- ✅ Background: Purple glassmorphism OKLCH(25.7% 0.09 281.288)
- ✅ Custom styling and effects

### Actual (Vercel Deploy):
- ❌ Title: "Video Chat Platform"
- ❌ Font: Default fonts
- ❌ Background: Basic styling
- ❌ Missing all recent updates

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. **✅ Force Deployment Trigger**
   - Added timestamp to trigger rebuild
   - Commit: `dcc26fc`

2. **✅ Updated vercel.json**
   - Changed name to "chatter-box-frontend"
   - Added environment variables
   - Added proper function configuration

3. **✅ Verified Local Code**
   - `app/page.tsx`: Contains CHATTER BOX ✅
   - `app/layout.tsx`: Has Google Fonts and purple background ✅
   - `app/globals.css`: Has custom font classes ✅

## Possible Root Causes

### 1. **Vercel Cache Issue**
- Vercel might be serving from old build cache
- Solution: Clear build cache in Vercel dashboard

### 2. **Wrong Repository Branch**
- Vercel might be deploying from wrong branch
- Check: Vercel project settings → Git → Production Branch
- Should be: `master`

### 3. **Build Environment Issues**
- Environment variables not properly set
- Google Fonts not loading during build
- Solution: Check Vercel build logs

### 4. **Multiple Projects**
- Old Vercel project might still be active
- Check if there are multiple projects for same repository

## Immediate Actions Needed

### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. **Go to Project Settings**
   - URL: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Project: Should be connected to `DalKirk/Next.js-14-Front-End-For-Chat-Plaster-Repository-`

2. **Check Git Configuration**
   - Ensure Production Branch = `master`
   - Ensure latest commit is being deployed

3. **Clear Build Cache**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Find latest deployment
   - Click "..." → "Redeploy" → Check "Use existing Build Cache" = OFF

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Should have: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`
   - Values: Point to `https://web-production-3ba7e.up.railway.app`

5. **Check Build Logs**
   - Look for Google Fonts loading errors
   - Look for CSS/styling build issues
   - Check for any failed imports

## Latest Commits to Deploy

```
dcc26fc - Update vercel.json with proper config and environment variables for CHATTER BOX deployment
6538ac2 - Force Vercel rebuild by updating config
e7c2dc5 - Update README with current deployment status
507a993 - Update branding to CHATTER BOX with Bitcount font and glassmorphism design
```

The key commit `507a993` contains all the CHATTER BOX changes and should be included in the deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Check Vercel Dashboard immediately**
2. **Verify which commit is being deployed**
3. **Force rebuild without cache if necessary**
4. **Monitor build logs for any errors**

## Expected Result After Fix

The live site should show:
- Title: "CHATTER BOX" in Bitcount Prop Double Ink font
- Purple glassmorphism background with animated gradient
- All custom styling and glass effects
- Proper Google Fonts loading
- Updated branding throughout
