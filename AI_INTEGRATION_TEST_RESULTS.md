## 🔧 Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify API Key
Check Railway environment variables:
- Go to Railway dashboard
- Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Verify it starts with `sk-ant-`
- Ensure no extra spaces or quotes

### 2. Check Anthropic Account
Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
- Verify API key is active
- Check usage/billing status
- Ensure you have API credits
- Verify model access permissions

### 3. Test API Key Directly
Try this in your terminal:
```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",
    "max_tokens": 10,
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}]
  }'
```

### 4. Check Railway Logs
```bash
# View recent logs
railway logs --tail 100
```

Look for:
- API authentication errors
- Rate limit warnings
- Connection timeouts

### 5. Alternative: Use Mock Mode
If you want to test the UI without Anthropic API:

In your backend, add a mock flag:
```python
USE_MOCK_AI = os.getenv("USE_MOCK_AI", "false") == "true"

@app.post("/ai/generate")
async def ai_generate(request: Request):
    if USE_MOCK_AI:
        return {"response": f"Mock AI response to: {prompt}"}
    # ... real API call
```

Then in Railway, add:
```
USE_MOCK_AI=true
```

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Check API Key First** - Most likely cause
2. **Use Mock Mode** - To test UI without API
3. **Monitor Railway Logs** - For detailed errors
4. **Contact Anthropic Support** - If key is valid but not working

Your implementation is solid! This is just an API configuration issue that can be resolved quickly. 🎯
